# Hiya! 

I exhausted myself trying to navigate data-retrieval to make a (seemingly) simple map, 
and after ALL that * *gestures around* * I didn't want anyone else to have to go through it. My hope is that at least this gives you a headstart!
If you want to collaborate or add to this dataset, please let me know!

# GIS info

# Data references
I'll try to add to this readme with the websites where I found this data in case you need different files.
